## Arcfrag UI HUD (fork: `-arcfrag.1`)

With [ArcfragCore](https://github.com/itsvenoxy/arcfrag-core) 0.8.0+ and the Arcfrag UI Workshop addon on the server, CSRoll
draws its HUD on Arcfrag's Panorama panels instead of center HTML (shared interface `arcfrag:core_hud`, `IPlatformModeHud`):

- **Roll reveal** (top centre): slot reel "ROLLING… / ROUND n", then 1–3 cards (icon, name, Buff/Nerf/Chaos/Ability tag,
  description decoding letter by letter). A modifier added mid-round gets the gold "NEW MODIFIER" card.
- **Modifier bar** (left): chip with the player's modifiers + up to 3 widgets (Vanish/Recall/Flanker = Ability,
  Jetpack/Conditional Invisibility = Gauge, Regeneration = Value, Weapon Roulette/Butterfly Effect = Rotor, Mimic = Stolen).
- **Spectator panel** (left, while dead): who you watch and their modifiers.
- Butterfly swaps, Mimic steals and Revive procs are toasts. The "Your modifiers:" chat summary stays.

Category and tone per modifier: `src/Core/ModifierLook.cs`. Without ArcfragCore (or without the addon, or outside
ArcfragCore's `HudModes`) everything stays center HTML as upstream. `lib/` holds the ArcfragCore contract (compile reference,
shipped as `resources/exports`); keep it at the ArcfragCore version of the servers.

## Commands

All commands are chat commands (prefix with `!`).

| Command | Access | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `!rolllist` | Everyone | Prints the name and description for each registered modifier. |
| `!rollactive` | Everyone | Prints the name, scope (Global or which player(s)), and description for each active modifier. |
| `!rollhelp` | Everyone | Prints every available CSRoll command. |
| `!rollmenu` | Admin | Opens the CSRoll configuration menu (random rounds, modifiers-per-player, per-modifier enable/disable). |
| `!memodifier <name>` | Admin | Apply a modifier scoped to just yourself, without affecting anyone else. |
| `!rolltoggle <name>` | Admin | Adds the modifier globally if inactive, removes it (from everyone currently assigned) if active. |
| `!removemodifier <name>` | Admin | Remove an active modifier. |
| `!removemodifiers` | Admin | Clear / Remove all active modifiers. |
| `!disablemodifier <name>` | Admin | Deactivate a modifier and remove it from the registered pool so it can't be added/rolled again until re-enabled (`!rollmenu`) or the plugin reloads. |
| `!addrandommodifier` | Admin | Add a random modifier to be activated immediately. |
| `!randomrounds` | Admin | Toggle random rounds on/off. |
| `!randomroundsreroll` | Admin | Re-roll the current random round modifiers and apply them to the current round. |
| `!rollreload` | Admin | Reload `config.jsonc` from disk without restarting the plugin or resetting active modifiers. |
| `!rolldebug` | Admin | Toggle whether per-player random-round assignments are reported to admins in chat. |

`MinRandomRounds`/`MaxRandomRounds` have no dedicated chat command - set them in `config.jsonc`, or adjust them at runtime via `!rollmenu` (menu changes are runtime-only and revert to the config file on the next full plugin reload). `Wallhack` is a regular modifier (manage it like any other via `!rolltoggle Wallhack` or `!memodifier`), not a dedicated command.

## Installation

1. Build the plugin (or grab a prebuilt release zip):
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```
2. Copy the published output (the `CSRoll` folder from `build/publish`, containing the DLL and `resources/` folder) into your CS2 server's:
   ```
   game/csgo/addons/swiftlys2/plugins/CSRoll/
   ```
   (i.e. the `SwiftlyS2/Plugins` folder for your server - the exact path depends on your SwiftlyS2 installation).
3. Restart the server, or use SwiftlyS2's plugin reload command if supported.
4. Tune behavior in the generated `config.jsonc` and `resources/translations/en.jsonc` files - both support editing without a rebuild (see comments inside each file for hot-reload behavior).

Requires [SwiftlyS2](https://swiftlys2.net) to be installed on your CS2 server.
