    // costing every player one round of PerPlayerRepeatCooldownRounds cooldown history, and playing
    // the spin-reveal banner animation twice in a row. Two genuinely separate rounds are always
    // several seconds apart (round time + freeze time), so a second EventRoundStart arriving
    // implausibly soon after the last one is treated as the same underlying transition and skipped
    // entirely. Deliberately scoped to just this automatic per-round-start path, not
    // ApplyRandomRoundsForRound itself - !randomroundsreroll and other manual admin triggers call
