/// Nothing stays put: the carrier gets a second modifier on top of this one, and every few seconds it
/// is thrown away and re-rolled into a different random one, for the whole round.
///
/// Only ever one extra at a time - this rerolls what you have rather than stacking onto it, so the
/// carrier is running exactly two modifiers (this plus one) at any moment no matter how long the
/// round runs.
///
/// Candidates come from Runtime.GetGrantableModifiersForSlot, which already excludes this modifier
/// itself, anything globally scoped (it would apply to the carrier regardless, making the swap look
/// broken), and anything incompatible with what they're currently running.
///
/// The countdown/roll presentation deliberately mirrors GameModifierWeaponRoulette: a "Timer: N,Ns"
/// HUD counting down, then a slot-machine roll flashing candidate names that STARTS SpinDurationSeconds
/// before the timer reaches zero, so it fills the timer's final stretch and lands exactly as the
/// timer hits 0 - rather than starting there and landing late. Same reasoning, same shape, same
/// MinFrameIntervalSeconds floor, so both modifiers read identically to a player.
///
/// The outgoing modifier is revoked when the roll STARTS, not when it lands: the pool the new one is
/// picked from has to reflect what the carrier will actually be running, or the outgoing modifier's
/// own incompatibilities keep filtering out candidates that are about to become perfectly legal. The
/// side effect is that the carrier has no extra modifier for the few seconds the roll is on screen,
/// which reads correctly - the HUD says "Rolling" for exactly that window.
