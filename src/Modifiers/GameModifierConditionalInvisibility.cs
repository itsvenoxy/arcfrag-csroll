/// The player(s) this rolled for are invisible while silent - making any sound (footsteps, gunfire,
/// reload, grenade throw, or starting a bomb plant) reveals them, and they fade invisible again after
/// a config-tunable cooldown of continued silence. Taking damage also reveals them, but as its own
/// short, snappy flash (DamageFlashDurationSeconds hold, DamageFlashFadeSeconds fade both ways)
/// completely independent of the sound-cooldown timer - getting hit is a single instant, not an
/// ongoing noise, so it shouldn't stay visible for a full SoundCooldownSeconds the way a footstep
/// does. See GetFadeDurationSeconds for how the two independent timers pick which fade speed applies
/// at any given moment. Scoped the same way every other per-player modifier is (via
/// IsAssignedTo/AssignedSlots) - this used to pick one random player itself instead, which meant it
/// couldn't participate in normal per-player random rolls at all (whoever the roll "gave" it to and
/// whoever actually turned invisible could be two different people). All the per-slot cosmetic state
/// below (fade alpha, HTML refresh timing, last-sound timestamps) is keyed by slot rather than a
/// single chosen one, since more than one assigned player is now possible.
///
/// Fade: transitions use a real alpha blend (RenderMode_t.kRenderTransAlpha + Color alpha channel)
/// ramped over FadeDurationSeconds, not an instant ShouldBlockTransmitEntity toggle. Going invisible
/// ramps alpha down to 0 while still network-visible, THEN transmit-blocks once fully transparent
/// (no visible pop). Going visible transmit-UNblocks first (so the client has an entity to render
/// at all) starting from alpha 0, then ramps up to fully opaque - the reverse order, for the same
/// reason. CheckHidePlayer/base hide-unhide plumbing still gate the final settled network state;
/// the alpha ramp is purely the cosmetic transition layered on top.
///
/// Status HUD: a center-HTML box showing how visible the player actually IS, as the same ASCII gauge
/// format Vanish uses (CSRollUtils.BuildGaugeHtml). The bar is driven by the live alpha ramp, not by
/// the cooldown - it fills toward 100% as they fade out, and reads red VISIBLE / yellow FADING /
/// green INVISIBLE according to where that ramp currently sits. It previously reported the logical
/// silence check instead, which flipped to INVISIBLE a whole fade duration before the player had
/// finished disappearing; see ShouldFadeToHidden for the matching offset that makes the fade land
/// exactly on the deadline rather than starting there.
