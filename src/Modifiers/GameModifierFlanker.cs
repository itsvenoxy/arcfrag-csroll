/// <summary>
/// Player-triggered ability, separate from TeleportOnReload/TeleportOnHit: starting on a cooldown
/// (RoundStartCooldownSeconds at round start/spawn, CooldownSeconds after every use), pressing the
/// "Inspect Weapon" button teleports the assigned player directly behind a random living enemy,
/// facing the same direction that enemy is.
///
/// The "Inspect Weapon" (+lookatweapon) bind has no named entry in SwiftlyS2.Shared.Events.
/// GameButtonFlags - SwiftlyS2 labels its members by their default keybind rather than the engine
/// action, and inspect defaults to F. Confirmed (not guessed) by cross-referencing the raw bit value:
/// GameButtonFlags.F = 34359738368 (2^35), which matches CounterStrikeSharp's own
/// InputBitMask_t.IN_LOOK_AT_WEAPON = 34359738368 exactly - the same underlying engine bit, just
/// named differently by each SDK's authors.
///
/// No explicit edge-detection is needed to stop a held key from firing repeatedly: the moment it
/// fires, NextAvailableTime is pushed CooldownSeconds into the future, so the very next tick (even
/// with the button still held) fails the readiness check. It can only fire again once the cooldown
/// has genuinely elapsed AND the button is down at that instant (or any tick after).
///
/// Landing: the destination is offset upward by DropHeight before teleporting, so the player falls a
/// short, harmless distance and lands with an audible thud - a silent, zero-warning teleport directly
/// into melee range felt like a completely free backstab; a landing sound gives the target (and
/// anyone else nearby) at least a chance to react to something having just appeared behind them.
///
/// Status HUD: a center-HTML popup is kept continuously visible (same re-send-before-it-expires
/// pattern ConditionalInvisibility/Vanish use) showing the trigger key and the current
/// state - gold "Ready" or red "Cooldown: N,Ns" (comma decimal separator) counting down live.
///
/// Wall check: the computed landing spot is validated with a zero-length TracePlayerBBox (see
/// IsPositionClear) before actually teleporting - without this, a target standing close to a wall or
/// corner could put the assigned player stuck inside solid geometry. A blocked spot is treated the
/// same as "no valid target": the attempt is skipped without consuming the cooldown.
