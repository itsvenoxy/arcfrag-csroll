/// Trigger and cooldown/HUD plumbing are the same shape as Flanker and Vanish (GameButtonFlags.F
/// polled per tick, cooldown pushed forward on use so a held key can't repeat, gauge refreshed on a
/// throttle behind Runtime.IsModifierHudSuppressed).
///
/// The rewind itself needs position history, which nothing else in this codebase keeps. Samples are
/// taken on an interval rather than every tick - at 64 tick a 3 second window would be ~192 samples
/// per player per life for no visible benefit, where 0.1s sampling gives 30 and still lands within
/// a tenth of a second of the intended moment. The buffer is a fixed-capacity queue trimmed by age,
/// so it can't grow without bound if a round runs long.
///
/// Health is restored, never granted: rewinding is capped at the health you actually had, and can
/// still lower your health if you healed since. Rewinding is deliberately allowed to be a downgrade
/// rather than silently skipping the health part, so the ability reads as a true "undo the last few
/// seconds" rather than a heal.
