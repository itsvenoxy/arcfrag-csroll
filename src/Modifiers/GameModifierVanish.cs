/// An activated superpower: press Inspect Weapon to disappear completely for a couple of seconds -
/// invisible AND holding nothing at all - then reappear with everything you were carrying, on a
/// cooldown.
///
/// Reworked from the old "FullInvisibility", which was a passive: permanently invisible, knife only,
/// and unable to buy or pick anything up for the whole round. Nothing about that behaviour survives -
/// outside the brief vanish window the player is completely normal, fully visible with their real
/// loadout. The internal Name changed too ("FullInvisibility" -> "Vanish"), so any config.jsonc
/// DisabledModifiers entry or admin command still naming the old one no longer matches.
///
/// Trigger: Inspect Weapon, polled off IPlayer.PressedButtons exactly as GameModifierFlanker
/// does. GameButtonFlags.F is CS2's IN_LOOK_AT_WEAPON - SwiftlyS2 names button flags after their
/// default keybind rather than the engine action, so the "F" here is the bind, not the letter. No
/// rising-edge tracking is needed: firing pushes the cooldown into the future, so a held key simply
/// fails the readiness check on every subsequent tick.
///
/// Invisibility reuses GameModifierInvisibleBase, which hides players by blocking network transmit
/// per-viewer rather than by touching render alpha, and already handles the death/spawn/spectator/
/// x-ray resync cases. The one thing that has to change for an activated power is CheckHidePlayer:
/// it must report "hidden" only while a vanish is actually running, otherwise the base's own resync
/// (on spawn, on someone else dying, etc.) would re-hide a player whose window had already expired.
///
/// Weapon handling deliberately uses the ammo-preserving strip/restore pair: a plain GiveItem hands
/// back a weapon at full default ammo, which on a ~20s cooldown would quietly turn this into a free
/// full reload on demand. The bomb is never touched (WEAPONTYPE_C4 is excluded), so plant/defuse is
/// unaffected, matching every other stripper in this codebase.
