/// <summary>
/// Forces the assigned player onto a single random gun (grenades untouched - buy/pickup of grenades
/// stays completely normal), re-rolled to a fresh weapon on a timer (Config.WeaponRoulette.
/// RerollIntervalSeconds). Reuses GameModifierRemoveWeapons for the strip/restore-on-disable and
/// CanAcquire.Pre buy-and-pickup block (same base RandomLoadout/WalkingGrenadier already use), scoped to
/// CSRollUtils.AllGunWeaponTypes so grenades are explicitly excluded from the block.
///
/// Bug fix (structural rewrite): the spin used to be driven by a self-rescheduling chain of
/// Core.Scheduler.DelayBySeconds calls - a mechanism no other modifier in this codebase uses. Every
/// other tick-based modifier (Flanker, Regeneration, etc.) drives 100% of its logic from
/// Core.Event.OnTick, so the instant OnDisabled() unsubscribes it, there is no code path left that
/// can still run - full stop, by construction. The DelayBySeconds chain lived entirely outside that
/// subscription and depended on manually re-checking generation/IsActive/IsAssignedTo on every single
/// frame to stop itself; despite that guard being logically correct on paper, it was reported live as
/// not actually stopping the spin/removing the modifier reliably. Rather than patch that guard again,
/// the spin is now driven by _spins (a per-slot state dict) advanced from the same OnGameTick loop
/// that already drives the reroll timer and countdown HUD - so disabling this modifier stops the spin
/// exactly the same way it stops everything else about it: unconditionally, with nothing left running.
///
/// Bug fix: the landing frame used to call CSRollUtils.StripWeaponTypes/ItemServices.GiveItem
/// directly - outside GameModifierRemoveWeapons' own _grantInProgress guard, which exists
/// specifically because this class's own CanAcquire.Pre hook blocks acquiring anything in
/// TypesToStrip, including its own forced grant (see that hook's bug-fix comment). Goes through the
/// base class's own (protected) StripWeapons instead, which wraps GiveReplacementWeapons in that
/// guard correctly.
///
/// Bug fix: a player receiving the modifier used to only get their first weapon via a separate
/// manual loop in OnEnabled, which meant anyone not yet alive at that exact moment (or connecting/
/// spawning mid-cycle) got nothing until the next scheduled reroll, up to RerollIntervalSeconds
/// later. GiveReplacementWeapons now triggers an immediate roll itself whenever it's asked to arm a
/// player with no weapon rolled yet for them - covering initial activation AND every later spawn
/// through the exact same code path (GameModifierRemoveWeapons' OnPlayerSpawn already calls this on
/// every spawn), so the separate OnEnabled loop is no longer needed.
///
/// Bug fix: the spin animation and the reroll-countdown HUD used to be two independent
/// SendCenterHTML call sites racing each other, each overwriting whatever the other had just shown -
/// visibly flickering/interrupting the spin. Unified into one BuildStatusHtml template (title +
/// timer-or-"Rolling" line + blank spacer + weapon line) used by both, and the countdown refresh
/// skips entirely for any slot currently mid-spin (tracked via _spins) rather than racing it.
///
/// Bug fix: "Rolling" used to render via HtmlGradient.GenerateGradientText - after repeated reports
/// that no spin animation was ever visible (just static "Rolling" text) even once the underlying
/// state-machine bug above was fixed, the gradient helper itself is dropped in favor of a plain
/// colored span, matching how every other HUD in this codebase (e.g. Flanker's own cooldown
/// text) already renders colored status text with no issues.
